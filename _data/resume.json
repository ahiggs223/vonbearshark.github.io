        "I am an undergraduate CS student at the University of Pittsburgh, expected to graduate May 2017.",
        "In December 2014 I joined OThot, a Pittsburgh-based data-science and analytics startup, as the primary frontend engineer. I used Angular.js and related technologies to develop the user interface for their analytics engine from the ground up for investor consideration.",
        "Over the summer of 2015, I interned with PayPal as a software engineer intern at the San Jose headquarters. As a part of the Next-Gen Commerce team, I worked directly alongside senior leadership and high-profile partners in a lean agile environment. I contributed to brainstorming and prototyping the latest payments technologies.",
        "When I returned to my studies in the fall, I joined the Pitt Quantum Repository, an open source initiative to aid in chemistry education. Using WebGL I developed the interface allowing classrooms to view and manipulate complicated 3D molecular structures in real time.",
        "Over the summer of 2016, I returned to PayPal as a software engineer intern, this time as a part of the Kraken team. I had put in a request to become a part of this team because I strongly support open source and inner source projects, and I sought the opportunity to develop backend technologies with Node.js. With the team, I developed a RESTful dashboard using Node.js, ReactJS, and D3.js to visualize collect and visualize company-wide traffic and security data for production applications.",
        "In addition to this professional experience, I have been involved with the Pitt Computer Science Club as vice president. Through the club, I have presented on various web development topics, organized multiple workshops from Pittsburgh industry leaders, and helped organize the university's first hackathon, Steelhacks.",
        "Technically, I have the most experience with isomorphic JavaScript stacks: Node, especially Express, Seneca, and Hapi; frontend frameworks and libraries, such as Angular, Backbone, and React; in addition to HTML/Handlebars, CSS/SCSS (and frameworks such as Pure and Bootstrap), and jQuery. Most of my formal CS education is in Java and Python, and I have used Django and Flask in personal projects. In storage, I am most familiar with NoSQL databases, especially MongoDB and Cassandra, but I have used MySQL as well. For ops, I am generally familiar with git, Linux environments, Vagrant and virtual machines, and Docker and the related ecosystem.",
        "In addition to my technical skills, I also have a wealth of communications, public relations writing, and social media management experience gained from my completed B.A. in English Writing, certificate in Professional and Public Writing, minor in Political Science, and related internships and volunteer work.",
        "I am looking to work in the company of equally passionate creators, on projects that impact the world at large."
