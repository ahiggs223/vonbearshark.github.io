Greetings from Albuquerque.

Holy long drive Batman.

Texas was just as I imagined it was. The drive was totally flat with little vegitation and you could see the horizon as you would at the beach see the horizon of the ocean. Huge power lines went into the horizon on both sides. I saw them disappear. I knew they kept going, but couldnt see them. We saw signs for: Catholic superstore and Free 72oz steak. There were tons of cows. More than I anticipated.

Amarillo was a sprawly place. But we got good barbeque and heard a bit of the accent.

As soon as we hit NM we saw Mesas pop up. We stopped at a stop. The gas nozzle was one of those old style with one nozzle. The restroom bathroom said out of order but it wasn't after we paid magically. An old man with brown teeth and a ten gallon hat asked us where we were going. Lots of dogs came out of their cars and started barking. There was a house next door we thought must be the owners.

Every so often we'd see a succession of about 15 signs, split on each side of the road, advertising and upcoming rest stop. They seemed to run out of things to advertise and had things like: Girl Things, Snake Things, and Knives!

We had Mexican food near Old Town. Old town is set up like peublos and has a lot of native American made stuff.

 There was an open might acoustic setup and a few hold guys, friends of the owner, were playing the Eagles and their own stuff. The owner reminded me a lot of Pehr. He showed us his back patio, his pharmacy, where he hands out cheap drugs (a former pharmacist), and he wouldn't take cards. He is called all about how "we the people" need to rise up and stop using the banks. He had three boxes while he was working: one for his business, one for his personal savings, and one for taking his girl out. After he saved enough he built his own Pueblo style place and he makes food from his garden fresh. The guys from the entourage and My big fat Greek wedding come in often, apparently.

Albuquerque is a good mix of old and new. Our host was late but nice. She told us about how her neighbor's was a real Pueblo, then her children build a bunch of houses around it after WWII. Our host is from LA. She seemed very sharp.

I'm nervous. We're heading to the Grand Canyon today, but we don't have a place to camp yet. And we're not prepared with food. And we'll be spending two nights camping, without showers, probably. And it's a six hour drive. So we need to get there quickly and set up shop before the sun goes down. And there's lots of poisonous nonsense.

We're getting a good breakfast and shower and heading out.
