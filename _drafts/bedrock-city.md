Good morning from Bedrock City.

Actually, my phone died. So good morning from KOA Williams.

Today is Zacs birthday, by the way. He told me a CEO bought him Laphroaig. I wish I could have.

Lyss helped with the drive to Flagstaff. It was a long and drumy drive. Not much to look at anymore. Just arid brush.

We saw the meteor crater. It was really well done. They had a test capsule from the Apollo missions.

Flagstaff was nice but much busier than we anticipated. We had a big dinner at a local Mexican place and it was delicious and enormous. Just what we needed.

The drive from Flagstaff is long and winding.

The Ten X campground was totally full. It was getting late, we didn't want to risk paying and taking the time to look for the grounds in the park, and the hotels were too expensive. So we settled for Bedrock City.

Bedrock City is hysterical. It was made in the 70s and then totally forgotten about. Its about 10 yards away from the highway. All of the buildings are curved as in the Flinstones cartoon, and painted those similar colors. However, this made them essentially a paint-caked, cement hot box. The bathrooms were muggy, and grimely, but sanitary. Lots of little graffitti. The signs said the secondary bathroom was being renovated, but it probably should be razed. All around the workers seemed almost annoyed at our presence. Maybe they felt if no one showed up they could close the place down. They had a general store that carries mostly Spam and beer.

But it was cheap, and they took cards.

The grounds are rocky and thorny, littered with cigarette buds. The other campers were hillbillies, with the exception of the one nice family that luckily stayed right next to us. The famuly even ler us borrow a rubber mallet. We didn't get so lucky on the other side and obese hicks from God knows where were cackling all night. After some trying, we got the hammock set up for the sunset. The motel and gas station across the street left their lights on all night, so we didn't get to see the stars from the gaudy light pollution. I didn't have a pillow, so I improvised with the hammock

The coin-operated showed was scalding hot. Also, the curtain didn't actually cover the tile, so my clothes got soaked. Good thing it was so hot out. They did have a laundromat, which was being renovated, and that was helpful.

Breakfast was a revolving door of local yocals. There was maybe four teeth amongst the half dozen or so regulars who came in, all on a first-name basis. They had tobacco-stained beards and overalls or sand-stained sweatpants from the Sears catalogue, forty years ago. The waitress, who was also the cook, was mean. And the food was a bland blunderbuss of whatever they remembered to order that week.

But it was cheap, and they took cards.

The have a little Bedrock City set up out back. More of the same paint-caked cement boxes, last touched well before I was born. It's hard to imagine the vision, the best-intentioned idea. The paintings were awful, done by someone who had no artistic inclination, and who may have never even seen a picture of a dinosaur before. There was a goat on exhibit. We were supposed to pay $5, but they set up the turnstile to face the wrong way and no one was manning it. I did enjoy their Volcano and Dinosaur structures. And one of the "cars", which all looked as they did in the cartoon, even had an electric motor.

Needless to say, we're sad to part from it.

We're headed to the Grand Canyon today, and then staying at a KOA.
