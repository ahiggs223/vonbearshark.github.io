Good morning from KOA Williams.

KOA is expensive, but awesome. It feels mess like camping and more like a hotel without rooms. The grounds are this fine rock, and we are given WiFi, an electric hookup, and water. There are free shower and laundry facilities. We met a couple of retirees coming from Atlanta. The man was a former pilot and counselor. We splurged on firewood, smores material, and beer, and we set up the hammock and had a great time.

Yesterday we saw the Grand Canyon.

We took the shuttle from the parking spot and walked up one of the lesser points along the south Rim. As we walked up, you could see it just growing ever deeper. Even when we got to the edge of the path we couldn't see the bottom.

The path is great: smooth and easy. Great for even the eldery and people and wheelchairs..

I was also impressed by the timeline of it all. 6 million years and 200+ miles. Everything about us is miniscule by comaprison. You could see the strata

The native tribes, like the Navajo.

We saw a few elk while at the Canyon. There was a mother and younger kid, who had a shaggy outer fur, which looked to be shedding. They were munching on trees and just popped up over the visitor's center. We also saw ground squirrels and crows; both were fearless. I'm afraid they all expect to be fed by tourists. The visitors center was absolute bedlum, akin to any other landmark. I don't know what I expected.

The facilities were nice. We wished we could have camped at the Mather site, but it was reserved. We got lunch there and headed to KOA.

Heading to Las Vegas today! We'll probably stop at the Hoover Dam. Viva!
