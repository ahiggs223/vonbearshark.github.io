Good morning from Las Vegas.

Last night we went to container park and Fremont St.

We had drinks at the Gold Spike, where Zappos took me for the interview process. We played a game of darts and the oversized jenga they have (2 by 4s instead of jenga blocks), and we watched other people play the trashcan beer pong. The bouncer was a former Steeler and Jet.

We saw robot dancers, lip sync ers, topless girls, showgirls, guy strippers, two country concerts, and magic shows. The overhead display made it seem like daytime.

We were tired and went to bed early.
