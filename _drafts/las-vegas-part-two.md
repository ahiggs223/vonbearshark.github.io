Good morning from Las Vegas.

Yesterday we went to the pool, the Strip, and gambling a little at the MGM.

The pool had a lazy river. Drinks and tubes were expensive, but it was relaxing. The water was warm and it was sunny.

I had a half-yard of beef with dinner.

We saw a light show at the Bellagio to the tune of Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.

We stopped in Le Casino, the Efiel Tower casino, and the inside looked like Paris, with a painted sky ceiling and cobblestone sidewalks and all. It was very convincing. Likewise, we stopped in New York New York, which was similarly done up to look like the city, and was similarly convincing. Finally, we stopped at Excalibur, and I admired their dedication to the medieval theme.

We couldn't figure out the slot machines and lost $15.

Today we are going to gamble a little more, maybe stop by New York New York,  and pick up food from that BBQ place in container park again before we head through the desert to San Diego.
