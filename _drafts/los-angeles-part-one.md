Good morning from Los Angeles.

Old Town was really neat.

I got a Pirate's poncho, mostly to support their having one.

The drive was as bad as you could imagine.

Our AirBnB is beautiful, and our hosts are neat.

The shower was a stand-up with rocks and wood, and they provided two robes.

We ordered pizza delivery and I went out for wine and scotch. I finally finished that cheapo beer we got at the KOA.

Today we will explore LA.
