Good morning from Memphis.

It was an easy drive here until Memphis itself, which was goofy and awful. We stopped at Graceland first.

Graceland is set up so that you take a personal iPad and headphones and just conduct your own tour. There's no yours or tour guides. I took my headphones out a few times and it was dead quiet. That was hysterical to me. There was a sorority group there who were worse than the children.

Obviously, it painted Elvis well. But I was still impressed. His was the first live televised concert and had more viewers than the moon landing. It also literally painted Elvis well; I wish I could have those ten-foot oil paintings of myself done.

We checked into the AirBnB. It's not great. It's a bachelor's pad in a poorer neighborhood in midtown with lots of sprawl around. It's dark and small, and the bed is essentially a futon. The adorable cat, Mrs. Whatever played with our shoelaces. I still don't trust her.

Our first Lyft driver was from Boston, but his Ma moved them all here when he was nine without telling him. They just never went back from a visit.

We had dinner at Central BBQ downtown. It was delicious. Lots of cops came in with lots of guns and vests. It's across from the Loirane hotel, where MLK was shot, which has been converted to the national civil rights museum. They have a great display and you can listen to a lot even at night, which we did.

Then we went to the Honky Tonks on Beale St. People are crazy friendly. Everyone I made eye contact with said something to me. Made me a little uncomfortable, honestly. We picked our place, Jerry Lee Lewis. The band was absolutely incredible. Three guys: drums, bass, and a lead who could sing and play guitar and piano. It was the first time I actually felt I was at a concert at a bar. And it was dead, so they were essentially playing right to us.

Our bartender was great, too. Very chatty. Oakland raiders fan. He showed me his Raiders tattoos.

Our Lyft driver home talked about how the Grizzles players are great community members, and are very involved as parents for the local high school sports scene.

The whole days was muggy and it was one of the worst sleeps I got in my life, but we're on the road to OKC today. We'll probably stop in Little Rock for an early dinner.
