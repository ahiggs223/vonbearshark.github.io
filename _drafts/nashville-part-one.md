Good morning from Nashville.

Lyss slept a lot on the car ride here. She was out drinking with her friends the night before, celebrating the end of her finals and the end of her first year as a masters student. Couldn't be more proud of us. This semester was a pain.

We stopped by Florence, Kentucky to have dinner with Racheal and her family. We came across this decaying bridge from Cincinnati into a different world. We got gas and there was a "trucker chapel" trailer at the station. We had dinner at the Cracker Barrel. There was a line out the door. It was mother's day, but I don't know if that makes it any better or worse. Her family was recognized as we sat down. This seemed like the highlight of the week for everyone inside. The whole town was sprawl--it had every big chain I could possibly know. Which was exciting, in it's own way. We said grace at the Cracker Barrel and ate things like fired chicken and cheese grits. Her whole family was obese. Her sister apparently did well enough in her studies, but flippantly spoke about civil engineering. I'm not sure they understand what it means to work hard in academia. They were very excited about a new gun they got, and Racheal's husband, Eddie, was extremely proud of his new car--a toyota something, maybe.

Our AirBnB is spectacular. The house is hip and beautiful. The dog, Connie, has not made up her mind about us yet. Or maybe she has forgotten. Last night, we sat on the back porch and had a bottle of proseco to celebrate.

I realized I forgot my laptop charger.

We have a lot of neat stuff planned for Nashville, but we'll see what we end up finishing.
