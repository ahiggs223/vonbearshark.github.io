Good morning from Nashville.

Yesterday was a lot of fun. I felt very relaxed. We walked to breakfast. The neighborhood was run-down mostly, but dotted with smart, young houses.

Our driver into the city grew up in France and spoke five languages. She mentioned how everyone outside of Nashville still conducts the civil war.

We saw the auditorium and it was a nice piece of history I never knew about. I thought about the irony of its original use as a brimstone preacher's podium (Sam Jones, who was against even baseball and bicycles), and how it ended up as Johnny Cash's place.

The hatch print shop was awesome. I think it should be required for all designers. It was neat how many designs they had that all just pressed ink from a raised block onto paper. We saw something similar in Boston, but it was neat to get different designs and a much different use-case. They were always for entertainment, rather than practical one-off jobs.

It was humid mostly, but not too bad. And my allergies managed to contain themselves.

Alyssa didn't feel well today, but we soldiered on anyway.

The Honky Tonks were hysterical: multiple floors of music and bars... Ten gallon hats and American eagle flag shirts.

Our cab home played "Lyft Lotto" with us. He turned on lights along his roof, and asked us questions about Nashville. We won the ticket but didn't get any money

We should be getting breakfast at Marche today, picking up some tums for Alyssa, and heading to Memphis.
