Good morning from OKC.

Yesterday we got a little lost on our way out but ended up seeing Cooper young area.

The drive to Little Rock was annoying. Little Rock itself was nice. It's very quiet and bright and green. We had catfish and Cajun mudbug (crawfish) for lunch. They were very spicy. We couldn't  figure it out at first, but then we got the hang of it.

The drive to OKC was easy and quiet. Arkansas is too big. But both OK and AR are green with sloping plains and farm houses with cattle or horses. It feels like the frontier. Very green.

The sky above OKC was spooky, given the recent tornado activity. We we finally pulled in around 9p we were happy to be done driving not looking forward to today's driving.

Our hosts were nice. Vegan hippies. He said he had couch surfed while teaching English in China and had great experiences.

On a related note, we may need to change our Grand Canyon accommodations. Apparently the facilities at Bedrock City are awful.

We're up early today and getting breakfast some place before we head out. Longest day today.
