Good morning from San Diego.

Yesterday we lost another $40, although Lyss was on a hot streak for a little, and picked up some of that BBQ from container park on our way out. It was eeiry seeing LV in the sober light of day, with all of the neon cowboys and rotating heels shutdown and dropping. If highlights the socioeconomic problems local residents face; this is the LV they live with.

We drove through the Mojave National Preserve. It wasn't the desert as I imagined; there was still a lot of brush. But it was sandier. This whole trip has just gotten progressively sandider and more arid.

There was terrible traffic around LA and San Diego. California drivers are objectively the worst. (OK drivers are probably the best.)

The AirBnB is a little disappointing for the price. It's a beautiful Victorian home run and decorated by hippies. Everything a little old, but it's being renovated, and the bed is super comfortable. Th house itself is massive, and feels like a hostel. It has an elaborate system of decks, with lots of flowers. We also have an outdoor shower and little balcony. Still, we are directly in the flight path for the airport, and about a half-mile from the busy freeways (I can easiky see both from the balcony [as well as the skyline]). The listing mentions the soundproof insulation, and the noise is better inside, but outside the planes are deafening, and inside they are still very much heard. Also, the owner has requested tips for his staff (who we haven't seen or noticed in any way), and has posted hundred of tacky rules for using the house all around the property. I feel like a child being scolded.

Last night we went to a trendy Italian place. We walked. It wasn't far. It was a nice night out, and everything felt like California: the air, the sounds, the hills.
