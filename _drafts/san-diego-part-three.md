Good morning from San Diego.

Yesterday we went to two beaches, both North of the city. The first was La Jolla cove. It wasn't really a beach: the only stretches of sand were lined with tourist in sandles, long white socks, and polos. I had never seen that before. It was cold earlier, and by the afternoon we did see some people make their way to the beach. We stuck around because there was a seal research facility and cove nearby. It is pupping season for the seals and they were sprawled out in rows along a few small cove beaches and rocks. They were so playful and mischievous.

After, we went to another beach. It was tucked away and a little hard to find. We walked down about two miles, and we found a dog beach with dozens or dogs playing in the water.

The traffic back to the AirBnB was insane. Almost dead stopped for the entire hour drive. In both directions. I don't know how people live like that.

At night we went to a restaurant, El Casa de Pico. It's a place Mrs. And Mr. Higgins went to while on vacation, before Alyssa. They have a souvenir margarita glass. The business has since moved to a strip mall outside the city, and they no longer issue those glasses. But we still enjoyed ourselves.

Today we will head to Old Town and then make it to LA.
