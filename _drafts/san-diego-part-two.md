Good morning from San Diego.

Yesterday we saw the San Diego zoo, then fell asleep early and slept for over 12 hours. To be fair, we spent over six hours running up and down the zoo in the beating sun. I don't know how we slept through all of the incoming flights overhead, or the buzz of the freeway.

We only missed the pangolin, and it wasn't shown on the map, so I don't know if that was our fault. We even went on a bus tour at the end of the day, just in case we missed anything. It's really well set up with the floral and walking paths.

We had breakfast where the pancakes are nearly the size of the table.

Today, we are heading to the beach and Old Town.
