        "I am an undergraduate CS student at the University of Pittsburgh, expected to graduate May 2017.",
        "Over this summer of 2015, I interned with PayPal as a software engineer intern at the San Jose headquarters. As a part of the Next-Gen Commerce team, I was treated as a full-time employee and contributed to brainstorming and prototyping the latest (and, unfortunately, confidential) payments technology with senior leadership and partners in a lean, startup-like, agile environment. I've also been working with OThot, a Pittsburgh-based data-science and analytics startup, since this January, helping build the user interface for their analytics engine from the ground up. In addition to this professional experience, I have been very involved with the Pitt Computer Science Club. I have presented on various web development topics, and helped organize the university's first hackathon, Steelhacks.",
        "Technically, I have the most experience with isomorphic JavaScript stacks: Node/Express, Seneca, Meteor, and frontend frameworks and libraries, such as Angular, Backbone, and React, in addition to HTML/Handlebars, CSS/SCSS (and frameworks such as Pure and Bootstrap), and jQuery. Most of my formal CS education is in Java and Python, and I have used Django and Flask for hackathon projects. In storage, I am most familiar with NoSQL databases, especially MongoDB and Cassandra, but I have used MySQL for the aforementioned hackathon projects. For ops, I am generally familiar with git, Linux environments, Vagrant and virtual machines, and, lately, I have been dipping my toes into Docker and the related ecosystem.",
        "In addition to my technical skills, I also have a wealth of communications, public relations writing, and social media management experience gained from my completed B.A. in English Writing, certificate in Professional and Public Writing, and related internships.",
        "I am looking to work in the company of equally passionate creators, on projects that impact the world at large.",
